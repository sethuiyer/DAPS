# Contributing to DAPS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DAPS (Dimensionally Adaptive Prime Search)! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sethuiyer/DAPS/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to DAPS:

1. Reporting bugs
2. Suggesting enhancements
3. Adding new features or improving existing ones
4. Improving documentation
5. Sharing benchmarks and test functions
6. Writing tests

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DAPS.git
   cd DAPS
   ```
3. Set up the upstream remote
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sethuiyer/DAPS.git
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment and install development dependencies
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

### Development Process

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, following the coding standards

3. Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Run style checks
   ```bash
   flake8 daps tests
   black --check daps tests
   ```

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

6. Push your changes to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Create a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Ensure your PR addresses a specific issue (or create one if it doesn't exist)
2. Include a clear description of the changes
3. Add tests for any new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Make sure all tests pass before submitting
6. Keep PRs focused on a single change

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
- Use type hints where appropriate

### C++ Code Style

- Follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Keep line length under 100 characters
- Add comments explaining complex logic

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use pytest for running tests
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)

## Documentation

- Update documentation when adding or changing features
- Write clear, concise documentation with examples
- Check documentation builds correctly by running `mkdocs serve`

## Adding New Test Functions

If you'd like to add a new test function to DAPS:

1. Add your function to `daps/functions.py`
2. Include detailed documentation including:
   - Mathematical formula
   - Domain/bounds
   - Global minimum location and value
   - Characteristics (e.g., multimodal, discontinuous)
3. Add tests for your function in `tests/test_functions.py`
4. Create a visualization if possible

Example:

```python
def my_test_function(x, y, z, param=1.0):
    """
    My Test Function
    
    f(x,y,z) = ... (mathematical formula)
    
    Domain: x,y,z âˆˆ [-10, 10]
    Global minimum: f(x*, y*, z*) = ... at (x*, y*, z*) = (...)
    
    Characteristics:
    - Multimodal with many local minima
    - Continuous and differentiable
    - Sensitive to parameter 'param'
    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    x, y, z : float
        Input coordinates
    param : float, optional
        Controls the scale of the function
        
    Returns:
    -------
    float
        Function value at (x, y, z)
    """
    # Implementation
    return result
```

## Benchmarking

If you'd like to contribute benchmarks:

1. Add your benchmark to `daps/benchmark`
2. Include comparison with other optimization methods
3. Document your benchmark methodology
4. Provide reproducible code and results

## Getting Help

If you have questions or need help, you can:

- Open an issue on GitHub
- Reach out to the maintainers
- Ask in the discussion section
