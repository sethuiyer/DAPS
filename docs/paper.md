Prime-Adaptive Search (PAS): A Novel Method for Efficient Optimization in Discontinuous Landscapes
</p>
<p>
This paper introduces Prime-Adaptive Search (DAPS), a novel optimization algorithm specifically designed for non-convex, discontinuous objective functions. By employing prime number-based grid sampling and adaptive domain shrinking, DAPS effectively avoids the sampling artifacts common in regular grid approaches while maintaining high efficiency. We demonstrate that DAPS outperforms traditional methods on challenging benchmark functions with discontinuities, multiple local minima, and fractal-like structures, without requiring gradient information. The algorithm's dimensional adaptivity makes it suitable for a wide range of optimization problems in scientific computing and engineering applications.

## Key Contributions

The DAPS research paper makes several key contributions to the field of optimization:

1. **Prime-based grid sampling**: A novel approach that uses prime numbers to avoid aliasing effects in grid-based sampling, ensuring more thorough exploration of the search space.

2. **Dimensional adaptivity**: The algorithm naturally adapts to the characteristics of the objective function in each dimension, allowing for efficient optimization in anisotropic landscapes.

3. **Discontinuity handling**: Unlike gradient-based methods, DAPS can effectively optimize functions with discontinuities, sharp features, and fractal-like structures.

4. **Theoretical guarantees**: We provide theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties and sampling efficiency.

5. **Empirical validation**: Comprehensive benchmarking against established optimization methods on a diverse set of challenging test functions.
