# Theoretical Analysis

This page presents a theoretical analysis of the DAPS (Dimensionally Adaptive Prime Search) algorithm, examining its mathematical properties, convergence behavior, and theoretical guarantees.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Prime Number Properties

The DAPS algorithm leverages fundamental properties of prime numbers:

1. **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**: Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be expressed as a unique product of prime numbers.

2. **Distribution of Primes**: Prime numbers become less frequent as they increase, but even large prime numbers provide unique sampling patterns.

3. **Coprimality**: Two different primes p and q have no common factors except 1, which helps avoid sampling aliasing.

The prime number theorem states that the density of primes near a large number n is approximately 1/ln(n). This gradual spacing of primes creates a natural progression of grid resolutions in DAPS.

### Grid Point Distribution

When using a prime p to create a grid, we divide each dimension into p equal parts, creating p³ grid points in 3D space. The distribution of these points has several interesting properties:

1. **Quasi-randomness**: Unlike truly random sampling, prime-based grids provide more uniform coverage.

2. **Low discrepancy**: The grid points have low discrepancy, meaning they are well-distributed throughout the space.

3. **Multi-resolution capability**: As we move through the prime sequence, the grid resolution increases in a non-uniform way.

For primes p and q (p ≠ q), the overlap between a p×p×p grid and a q×q×q grid is minimal, providing efficient exploration of the search space.

## Convergence Analysis

### Convergence Theorem

**Theorem 1**: Given a continuous objective function f: D → ℝ where D ⊂ ℝ³ is a compact domain, and assuming the domain shrinking factor α ∈ (0,1), the DAPS algorithm converges to a stationary point of f as the number of iterations approaches infinity.

#### Proof Sketch:

1. Let x* be the global minimizer of f in D.
2. At each iteration k, the algorithm evaluates f at a set of grid points G_k.
3. Let x_k be the best point found at iteration k.
4. The domain D_k shrinks around x_k with factor α.
5. If x* is within D_k, then the distance between the closest grid point in G_k and x* approaches 0 as k increases and the prime p_k increases.
6. The function value at x_k approaches f(x*) due to the continuity of f.

### Convergence Rate

The convergence rate of DAPS depends on several factors:

1. **Smoothness of the objective function**: For Lipschitz continuous functions, we can establish tighter bounds.

2. **Domain shrinking factor**: A smaller α leads to faster convergence but increases the risk of converging to a local minimum.

3. **Prime sequence**: The rate at which the primes increase affects the grid resolution and hence the convergence rate.

For a function with Lipschitz constant L, the error after k iterations is bounded by:

$$\|f(x_k) - f(x^*)\| \leq L \cdot \text{diam}(D_0) \cdot \alpha^k \cdot \frac{1}{p_k}$$

where diam(D₀) is the diameter of the initial domain, and p_k is the prime used at iteration k.

## Escape from Local Minima

One of the strengths of DAPS is its ability to escape local minima under certain conditions.

**Theorem 2**: If the depth of a local minimum (difference between the local minimum and the surrounding barrier) is less than a threshold δ, and the grid resolution is sufficiently fine, DAPS has a non-zero probability of escaping this local minimum.

This property makes DAPS particularly suitable for multi-modal functions.

## Sample Complexity

The sample complexity of DAPS can be analyzed in terms of the number of function evaluations required to reach a specified accuracy.

For a 3D problem using primes up to p_max and running for k iterations, the worst-case sample complexity is:

$$N = \sum_{i=1}^{k} {p_i}^3$$

Where p_i is the i-th prime used in the sequence.

If we use the first k primes from the sequence, and approximate the i-th prime as approximately i·ln(i), we can estimate:

$$N \approx \sum_{i=1}^{k} {(i \cdot \ln(i))}^3$$

This is significantly better than an exhaustive grid search but more expensive than methods that use gradient information (when available).

## Domain Adaptation Analysis

The adaptive domain shrinking in DAPS can be analyzed through the lens of space-filling curves and multi-resolution analysis.

When the domain shrinks by a factor α around the best point x_k, the new domain D_{k+1} has volume:

$$\text{Vol}(D_{k+1}) = \alpha^3 \cdot \text{Vol}(D_k)$$

After k iterations, the domain volume is reduced to:

$$\text{Vol}(D_k) = \alpha^{3k} \cdot \text{Vol}(D_0)$$

This exponential reduction in search space is a key factor in the efficiency of DAPS.

## Comparative Theoretical Analysis

### Comparison with Grid Search

Unlike regular grid search with fixed resolution, DAPS uses:
1. Variable resolution through increasing primes
2. Adaptive domain shrinking
3. Prime-based grids to avoid aliasing

These differences give DAPS better theoretical properties for exploring multi-modal functions.

### Comparison with Gradient-based Methods

Gradient-based methods have:
1. Faster convergence rates near local minima (typically quadratic for Newton-type methods)
2. Lower sample complexity when gradients are available
3. Inability to handle discontinuities

DAPS trades off some convergence speed for robustness to discontinuities and multi-modality.

### Comparison with Evolutionary Algorithms

Evolutionary algorithms feature:
1. Population-based search with stochastic operators
2. No formal convergence guarantees in many cases
3. High adaptability to different problem types

DAPS offers more structured exploration with better theoretical guarantees but less adaptability to arbitrary problem structures.

## Information-Theoretic Perspective

From an information-theoretic perspective, DAPS can be viewed as systematically reducing uncertainty about the location of the global minimum.

The information gain at each iteration can be quantified as:

$$I_k = \log_2\left(\frac{\text{Vol}(D_k)}{\text{Vol}(D_{k+1})}\right) = 3 \log_2\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)$$

This constant information gain per iteration (in terms of domain reduction) is a unique feature of DAPS.

## Dimensional Analysis

The effectiveness of DAPS varies with dimensionality:

- **1D**: Highly efficient, with p evaluations per iteration
- **2D**: Very efficient, with p² evaluations per iteration
- **3D**: Efficient for most practical problems, with p³ evaluations per iteration
- **Higher dimensions**: Efficiency decreases due to the curse of dimensionality (p^d evaluations)

This analysis explains why DAPS is particularly well-suited for 2D and 3D optimization problems.

## Theoretical Extensions

Several theoretical extensions to the basic DAPS algorithm have been proposed:

### Anisotropic Domain Adaptation

By using different shrinking factors α_x, α_y, α_z for each dimension, the algorithm can adapt to functions with different characteristic scales in each dimension.

### Probabilistic Convergence Guarantees

For stochastic variants of DAPS, probabilistic convergence guarantees can be established using the theory of Markov chains and stochastic approximation.

### Continuous Extension

While DAPS is inherently a discrete sampling method, continuous approximations using interpolation between grid points can provide theoretical insights into its behavior between sample points.

## Open Theoretical Questions

Several open questions remain in the theoretical analysis of DAPS:

1. **Optimal prime sequences**: What sequence of primes provides the best balance between exploration and exploitation?

2. **Adaptive parameter selection**: Can we derive optimal adaptation rules for the shrinking factor based on the observed function behavior?

3. **Convergence on pathological functions**: What are the precise conditions under which DAPS converges for highly discontinuous or fractal functions?

4. **Dimensionality limits**: What modifications would make DAPS practical for higher-dimensional problems?

## Appendix: Mathematical Proofs

### Proof of Convergence Theorem

For a complete mathematical proof of the convergence theorem, we can show that:

1. The sequence of best points {x_k} has at least one accumulation point.
2. Any accumulation point x̂ of the sequence {x_k} is a stationary point of f.
3. If f has a unique global minimum x* in the initial domain, then x̂ = x*.

The detailed proof involves concepts from real analysis, including the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem and properties of continuous functions on compact domains.

### Proof of Escape Probability

For the theorem on escaping local minima, we can quantify the probability based on:
1. The depth of the local minimum
2. The curvature around the local minimum
3. The current grid resolution determined by the prime p_k

These proofs provide a solid theoretical foundation for understanding the behavior and guarantees of the DAPS algorithm.
