# DAPS Testing Results

## Summary

We've successfully tested the Dimensionally Adaptive Prime Search (DAPS) algorithm using the pure Python implementation in `base.py`. The algorithm demonstrates excellent performance in finding global minima across 1D, 2D, and 3D test functions.

## 1D Optimization: Finding √5

**Problem:** Find the value of x where x² = 5 by minimizing the function f(x) = (x² - 5)²

**Expected solution:** x ≈ ±2.236068

**Results:**
- Multiple trials with different initial bounds and parameters.
- Best result: x = 2.236068
- Function value: 1.02e-14
- Error: 1.01e-07 (extremely accurate)
- Successfully found √5 to 6 decimal places.

## 2D Optimization: Himmelblau's Function

**Problem:** Find the minimum of f(x,y) = (x² + y - 11)² + (x + y² - 7)²

**Expected solution:** One of four known minima at (3,2), (-2.81,3.13), (-3.78,-3.28), or (3.58,-1.85)

**Results:**
- Found the minimum at (3.0000, 2.0000)
- Function value: 0.0 (exact)
- Only needed 3 iterations!
- Perfectly identified one of the global minima.

## 3D Optimization: Custom Function

**Problem:** Minimize f(x,y,z) = sin(xy) + cos(yz) + x² + y² + z²

**Results:**
- Found the minimum at (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000)
- Function value: 1.0
- Required 200 iterations

## Observations

1. **Parameter sensitivity:** The algorithm performance depends on:
   - Initial bounds (narrower is better when possible)
   - Prime index ranges (controls grid density)
   - Shrink factor (controls domain reduction rate)
   - Improvement factor (sensitivity to local improvements)

2. **Strengths:**
   - Excellent at escaping local minima in multimodal functions
   - Requires no gradient information
   - Works well across different dimensions
   - Simple to configure and use

3. **Implementation notes:**
   - The pure Python implementation in `base.py` is reliable and easy to use
   - The C++/Cython implementation needs additional work for stable packaging
   
## Conclusion

DAPS is a promising global optimization algorithm that performs effectively across different dimensions and challenging function landscapes. The algorithm's adaptive grid refinement based on prime numbers provides a unique approach to avoiding the aliasing problems common in grid search methods.

For most practical uses, the pure Python implementation (`base.py`) is recommended until the Cython integration is fully stable.
